# Project_University_Acceptance_GUI_Java

Java
This app has a very simple GUI made with Java AWT and Swing, that lets us work with information regarding students and the exams they took in order to 
be accepted to a specific university. We can enter new students, delete or update them with the help of a database. The same with new subjects/exams.
